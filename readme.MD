# Mannheim OSM Preprocessing for Network Simulations
This script reproduces the Mannheim data acquisition and preprocessing pipeline used for the paper’s network-based simulations. It downloads Mannheim’s administrative boundary and pedestrian (“walk”) network from OpenStreetMap via OSMnx, retrieves transit stops, alcohol-relevant retail outlets (e.g., kiosks, supermarkets, liquor shops, petrol stations), and residential buildings from OSM tags, converts non-point geometries to centroids, and snaps all features to the nearest walking-network node (dropping features beyond a specified maximum snapping distance). It exports single-layer GeoPackages for the routable network edges and the snapped origin/midpoint/destination node layers, along with a small CSV summary of feature counts, providing the standardized Mannheim inputs for subsequent exposure and policy-simulation analyses.
